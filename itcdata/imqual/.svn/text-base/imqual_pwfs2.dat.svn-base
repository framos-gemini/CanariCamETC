# image quality model for ITC

# 70%-ile conditions, with PWFS, zenith pointing

# columns are (1) wavelength in nm, (2) 50% encircled energy diameter

# source: advertised tip-tilt models, with 300nm and
# 20um points guesses

# author: Phil Puxley
# created 23Nov1999

# modified 29Aug2002 to be 70%-ile distribution
# added guess of 30um point for mid-IR ITC

# modified 6Mar2003
# added J value

# Modification: Carlos Alvarez and Fran Ramos (2014/07/05).
# The ITC code indicates that FWHM must be used instead of EED50.
# Therefore the following values represent the statistical
# FWHM in the Si2-8.7, Si5-11.6 and Q1-17.65 filters using
# actual measurements on standard stars. The Si2-8.7 filter
# FWHM values have been obtained from 98 measurements from the
# CanariCam ESO-GTC program (dates between December 2012 and March 2014). 
# The Si5-11.6 and Q1-17.65 data have been obtained from 144 
# measurements in Si/Q ratio standard stars (dates between 
# June 2011 and May 2014).
