# image quality model for ITC

# 20%-ile conditions, with OIWFS, zenith pointing

# columns are (1) wavelength in nm, (2) 50% encircled energy diameter

# source: advertised tip-tilt models, with 300nm, 10um and
# 20um points guesses

# author: Phil Puxley
# created 23Nov1999

# modified 29Aug2002 to better match extant seeing distributions at
# 300-3400nm

# added guess of 30um point for mid-IR ITC
