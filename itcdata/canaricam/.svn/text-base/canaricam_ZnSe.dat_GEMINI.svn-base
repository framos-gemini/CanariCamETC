# Transmission curve for T-ReCS ZnSe (Zinc Selenide) window. 
# Columns are (1) wavelength in nm, (2) transmission.
# Data from Janos web site plot for ZnSe with 8-12 micron AR coating.
# The 13750 and 14500 nm points are extrapolations by TLH.  
#
# This filter is only used in the 7-14 micron wavelength range.
