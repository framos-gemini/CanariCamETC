# trecs-elfn.dat
# 
# Defines extra "low frequency noise" for
# T-ReCS detector. Used to scale the source
# and background shot noise VARIANCE, e.g.:
#  effective bckgrnd variance = bckgrnd signal * elfn_param
#  effective source variance = source signal * elfn_param
#
# set initial value to 16 (i.e. 4x noise) to provide
# some performance margin. Pre-ship AT results suggest
# actual value is closer to 3x
# Phil Puxley 2003 April 9 
#
# updated value based on 2003jun9 and 12 photon
# transfer curve (on-telscope) which suggests
# actual value is ~1.5. Adopt 2x for ITC to give
# some margin.
