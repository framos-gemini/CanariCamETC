# Ref. WL = wavelength of laser used to measure spectroscopic 
# resolution.  LoRes-20 grating was measured in 2nd order;   
# results here have been scaled to 1st order.
#
# Blaze wavelengths are: LR-10: 10.9, LR-20: 21.9, HR-10: 10.4
#    
# d_lambda is the resolution in nm - constant with wavelength
# d_lambda and R_at_ref are for 0.50 arcsec slitwidth
# nm/pixel is dispersion for unbinned pixels
#
# Grating      Ref. WL   R_at_ref  d_lambda  nm/pixel
#                [nm]               [nm]
