# transparency (cloud cover) model for ITC
# 70%-ile conditions; these conditions are thin cloud
# columns are (1) wavelength in nm, (2) transparency (0-1)
# source: assume 0.5 mag (60% transmission) and grey
# made up for now!!

# Modified to 0.3 mag attenuation (76% transmission) - thought to be 
# more in keeping with experience and kept grey
