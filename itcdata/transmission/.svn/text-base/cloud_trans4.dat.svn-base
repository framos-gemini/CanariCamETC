# transparency (cloud cover) model for ITC
# 90%-ile conditions; these conditions are thick cloud
# columns are (1) wavelength in nm, (2) transparency (0-1)
# source: assume 1mag (factor 2.5) attenuation
# and unusable beyond 2.5um
# made up for now!!

# Modified to 2 mag attenuation (16% transmission) - to be
# more consistent with web page and experience
